# Bike_Sharing_Demand Project Overview:

* Applying various regression models to historical usage patterns and weather data. 
* Models can then be used to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.
* Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis performed to understand the data and inform feature engineering.
* Target data 'count' was normalized using a log transformation.
* An initial Linear Regression model and Random Forest regressor were used to gauge a baseline performance.
* Gradient Boosting Regresser and Support Vector Machine Regressor were optimized using GridSearchCV.
* Optimized Gradient Boosting Regressor offered the best performance with an R^2 value of 0.945 and RMSLE of 0.100
